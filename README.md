# Advanced Financial Data Analysis and Forecasting System  
**Week 1 Milestone: Data Pipeline (API ‚Üí PostgreSQL)**  

---
## üìå Overview  
This README covers the setup and implementation of the **data ingestion and ETL pipeline** for the financial forecasting system. By the end of Week 1, you'll have a working pipeline that:  
1. Fetches high-frequency financial data from an API (e.g., Alpha Vantage).  
2. Cleans and transforms the data.  
3. Stores it in a PostgreSQL database with TimescaleDB for time-series optimization.
